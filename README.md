# Phantom-Black-Jack
Developed using C++ 20. \
CMake used for building and testing. \
*Used Boost v1.86.0 for unit testing. \

note: C++ unit testing was more cumbersome to setup than I had expected. \
*Boost asset behvaiour is different to what I had expected so it wasn't worth using. Essentially, it wasn't throwing any errors when testing for any incorrect asserts.
